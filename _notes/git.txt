Two branches for AI/MMAI:

    main
    main-ml

main-ml always rebases main.
Non-ML fixes (ie. those that need to go in both) must be ported to main.

Usually, such fixes are first made in main-ml, in which case the flow is:
    # ... Fix & commit in main-ml...

    $ git h             # note fix commit hash:
    $ git co main
    $ git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
    $ git co main-ml
    $ git rebase main
