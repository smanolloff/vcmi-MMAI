1. Check stack overflow with attack logs
  can defender be null?





3. check if GENERAL_ATTACK_REDUCTION is affected by FORGETFUL
  (and remove FORGETFUL if so)

4. check the MOAT obstacle type trigger (is it a SpellID - which?!)
5. check the firewall obstacle type trigger (is it a SpellID::FIRE_WALL?
    There is fireWallDamage ability, but no such spell.
6. check the QUICKSAND and LAND_MINE triggers - are they corresponding spell ids?
7. check tower moat-mines - are they a SPELL_CREATED obstacle type?

4. (optional) Handle spellcast of LAND MINE - probably there's something
  like a list of affected hexes, and return them with the appropriate
  HEX_STATE. This would make sense only if the agent uses LSTM though.

5. CBattleInfoCallback::getRandomCastedSpell
  seems to check only if stack has bonus `SPELLCASTER`
  What about `RANDOM_SPELLCASTER` (Genie)?
  Does it have both?

6. Use pybind11 STL
